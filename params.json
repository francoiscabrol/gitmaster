  "body": "GitMaster - Manage a set of git repositories\r\n=========\r\n\r\nGitMaster is a small command line tool that solve two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Offer an overview of all your git repositories in any directory as your $HOME/WORKSPACE.\r\n\r\n2. Manage a set of git repositories with a third git \"master repo\". For example, you have a project with several services or subprojects, Each project is store in a different repository. You want to allows any developer to clone the master repository and then clone all repositories. Then you want to allow the developer to check or pull every repositories at the same time. This tool do that.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n`gmaster help` list the commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n | dump   Dump the list of repositories in the .gitmaster file\r\n | init   Clone all repositories defined in the .gitmaster file\r\n | fetch  Fetch each repositories\r\n | status Show the status of each repositories\r\n | pull   Pull each repositories\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeveral commands can be executed in the same run. \r\nFor example, `gitmaster fetch status` is going to first fetch the last remote versions and then display the status of each repository.\r\n\r\nInstall it\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis command is going to install the last release for you. You can replace the GITMASTER_PATH to install it in an other folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport GITMASTER_PATH=/usr/bin/gmaster && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francoiscabrol/gitmaster/master/install.sh | bash -x\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequirement: You need java installed. And git of course.\r\nI tried it under MacOS, Linux Ubuntu and Arch Linux. It should works under window also but I don't know how to install it.\r\n\r\nUnder Linux/Macos, you have just to copy the \"gmaster\" file in your bin path. For example under /usr/bin/.\r\n\r\nThen you will be able to run it direcly in your terminal.\r\n`gmaster help`\r\n\r\nYou can try to run `gmaster` in your Workspace to check the status of your repositories.\r\n\r\nBuild it yourself\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nRequirement: You need sbt (simple build tool) installed.\r\n\r\nThen run `sbt assembly` to build the gmaster executable.\r\n\r\nDevelop\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRequirement: You need sbt (simple build tool) installed.\r\n\r\nRun it with `sbt run ARGUMENTS` like `sbt run help` or `sbt run --dir ~/path/of/repositories/ status`\r\n\r\n",
